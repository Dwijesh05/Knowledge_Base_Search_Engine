# üß† Knowledge Base Search Engine

A browser-based, client-side RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that allows you to chat with your documents. Upload PDF and TXT files to create a temporary knowledge base and ask questions to get synthesized answers from Google's Gemini models.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Upload Multiple Files**: Supports both PDF and TXT file formats.
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface for uploading files.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All file processing and API calls happen directly in your browser. No data is sent to a server.
- **Local Storage**: Your Google API key and uploaded document content are saved in your browser's local storage for session persistence.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses the Google Generative AI API to answer questions based on the content of your documents.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from different Gemini models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro) to tailor the response.
- **Source Citations**: The AI-generated answers are based on and cite the provided documents.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap for a clean and accessible interface on all devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application implements a simple RAG pipeline entirely on the client-side:

1.  **Document Upload & Parsing**: When you upload a PDF or TXT file, its text content is extracted using `PDF.js` or the `FileReader` API.
2.  **Local Indexing**: The extracted text from all documents is stored in the browser's local storage, creating a searchable knowledge base.
3.  **Retrieval**: When you ask a question, the application performs a keyword-based search across all uploaded documents to find the top 3 most relevant text chunks.
4.  **Augmentation**: These relevant chunks (the "context") are combined with your original question into a detailed prompt.
5.  **Generation**: The complete prompt is sent to the selected Google Gemini model via its REST API.
6.  **Response**: The model generates a comprehensive answer based *only* on the provided context. The application then displays this answer, along with the source documents it referenced.
